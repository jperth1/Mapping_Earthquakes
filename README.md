# Mapping_Earthquakes
This repository presents the mapping of global earthquake data using JavaScript, D3, Leaflet, and Mapbox. Javascript, D3, and the Leaflet library are used to parse and retrieve geoJSON earthquake data and tectonic plate data from US geological survey website. The data is plotted on a Mapbox map via API requests. The magnitude and location of the earthquakes are shown as a popup marker, where the diameter of the popup marker reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker. To illistrate the relationship between location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, fault lines are added to the map. Three map layers--"Street", "Satellite", and "Night"--are included for dynamic visualization.
