# Mapping_Earthquakes
This repositories includes the mapping of global earthquake data using JavaScript, D3, Leaflet, and Mapbox. Javascript, D3, and the Leaflet library is used to parse and retrieve geoJSON earthquake data and tectonic plate data from US geological survey website. The data is plotted on a Mapbox map via API request. On the map the magnitude and location of the earthquakes is shown in a popup marker, where the diameter of the popup marker for each earthquake reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker. To illistrate the relationship between location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, fault lines are added to the map. Three map layers--"Street", "Satellite", and "Night"--are included for dynamic visualization.
